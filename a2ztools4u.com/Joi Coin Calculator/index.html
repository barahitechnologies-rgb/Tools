    <h2>How We Calculate Jio Coin Price Prediction for 1 to 20 Years</h2>
    <p>The Jio Coin Calculator helps you estimate how many coins you can earn over time and their potential value. Here’s how the calculation works:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Input Your Usage</h3>
    <p>Enter the <strong>number of hours</strong> you spend using Jio services daily. For example, if you use Jio apps for 2 hours a day, enter "2."</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Coins Earned Per Year</h3>
    <p>Jio Coins are earned based on your usage. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <p>If you earn <strong>46.8 coins per hour per year</strong>, using Jio services for 2 hours a day would earn you:
        <pre>46.8 × 2 = 93.6 coins per year.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 3: Annual Growth</h3>
    <p>The calculator assumes a <strong>10% annual growth</strong> in coins earned. This means your earnings increase by 10% each year due to increased engagement or higher rewards.</p>
    <ul>
      <p>Year 1: 93.6 coins</li>
      <p>Year 2: 93.6 × 1.10 = 102.96 coins</li>
      <p>Year 3: 102.96 × 1.10 = 113.26 coins</li>
      <p>And so on.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 4: Projections for Low, Medium, and High Scenarios</h3>
    <p>The calculator provides three growth scenarios for your Jio Coins:</p>
    <ul>
      <p><strong>Low (5%):</strong> Assumes a conservative growth rate of 5% per year.</li>
      <p><strong>Medium (25%):</strong> Assumes a moderate growth rate of 25% per year.</li>
      <p><strong>High (100%):</strong> Assumes an aggressive growth rate of 100% per year.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 5: Visualizing Growth</h3>
    <p>The calculator also includes a <strong>projection chart</strong> that shows how your coins grow over 20 years for each scenario (Low, Medium, High). This helps you visualize the potential value of your Jio Coins.</p>
